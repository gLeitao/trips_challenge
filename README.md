### Python Libraries

You will also need to install the following Python libraries:

```
pip install \
    boto3==1.26.81 \
    botocore==1.29.81 \
    jmespath==1.0.1 \

    urllib3==1.26.14
```

## Running the AWS Infrastructure

```terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
```
This will create an the required infra to run this project.

## Running the ETL
To run the ETL process, go to the scripts/upload folder and execute the following command:
```
python upload_local_file_s3.py --path /path/file.csv
```
`Remeber to replace /path/file.csv with the path to your CSV file. ` 

This process will upload the CSV to S3 and invoke the Step Function, the workflow orchestrator responsible for triggering the ETLs that process the data.
